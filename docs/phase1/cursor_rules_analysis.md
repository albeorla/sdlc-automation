### Core Code Quality Rules (3)
1. **code_quality.mdc**: General quality guidelines, including avoiding duplication and magic numbers
2. **naming_conventions.mdc**: Naming standards for all code elements
3. **error_handling.mdc**: Comprehensive error handling guidelines

### Core Architecture Rules (4)
1. **architecture_patterns.mdc**: Architectural guidelines including service design
2. **dependency_management.mdc**: External dependency guidelines
3. **module_boundaries.mdc**: Module separation and interaction rules
4. **api_design.mdc**: API structure, versioning, and documentation

### Core Performance Rules (3)
1. **performance_optimization.mdc**: General performance guidelines including UI and network
2. **database_optimization.mdc**: Database efficiency guidelines
3. **memory_management.mdc**: Memory usage and optimization

### Core Security Rules (4)
1. **security_best_practices.mdc**: General security including data protection
2. **input_validation.mdc**: Input validation including XSS and SQL injection prevention
3. **authentication.mdc**: User authentication guidelines
4. **authorization.mdc**: Access control and permission management

### Core Testing Rules (3)
1. **test_coverage.mdc**: Coverage requirements and metrics
2. **unit_testing.mdc**: Unit test practices including mocking and test data
3. **integration_testing.mdc**: Integration and system test guidelines

## Rule Enhancement Recommendations

To make rules more dynamic and context-aware:

1. **Add Context Detection**:
   - Include file path patterns to automatically apply rules to relevant files
   - Example: Apply database_optimization.mdc to files in */repositories/* or */dao/* directories

2. **Convert to Guided Prompts**:
   - Transform static rules into question-based prompts
   - Example: Instead of "Use parameterized queries", use "Have you ensured all database queries are parameterized to prevent SQL injection?"

3. **Include Examples**:
   - Add concrete examples of both good and bad practices
   - Example: Show a vulnerable code snippet alongside a secure version

4. **Add Severity Levels**:
   - Classify rule violations by severity (Critical, High, Medium, Low)
   - Example: Mark authentication bypass as Critical, style inconsistencies as Low

5. **Link to Resources**:
   - Include links to relevant documentation, articles, or internal resources
   - Example: Link to detailed security documentation for security rules

## Implementation Plan for Rule Simplification

1. **Document Core Rules**:
   - Create detailed documentation for each core rule
   - Include clear trigger conditions and file patterns
   - Document examples and severity levels

2. **Merge Similar Rules**:
   - Combine code_duplication.mdc and magic_numbers.mdc into code_quality.mdc
   - Incorporate service_design.mdc into architecture_patterns.mdc
   - Merge rendering_performance.mdc and network_efficiency.mdc into performance_optimization.mdc
   - Consolidate data_protection.mdc into security_best_practices.mdc
   - Merge xss_prevention.mdc and sql_injection.mdc into input_validation.mdc
   - Incorporate test_data.mdc and mocking.mdc into unit_testing.mdc

3. **Enhance Rule Format**:
   - Convert all rules to question-based format
   - Add file pattern matching for automatic application
   - Include examples of correct and incorrect implementations
   - Add severity classifications
   - Include links to additional resources

4. **Update References**:
   - Update all documentation referring to deprecated rules
   - Create redirects or aliases for backward compatibility
   - Update training materials for onboarding
