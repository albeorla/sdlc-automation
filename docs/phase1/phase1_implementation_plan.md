# Phase 1: Consolidation & Refinement Implementation Plan

## Objective
Reduce the cognitive load required to understand and navigate the system.

## Detailed Tasks

### 1. Consolidated Core Guidance

#### Contributor Quick Start Guide (Human-focused)
- Purpose: Provide a single entry point for human contributors
- Content sources:
  - agent_interaction.md
  - git_workflow.md
  - handling_changes.md
  - agile/process.md
- Key sections:
  - Getting started (environment setup)
  - Repository structure overview
  - Common workflows (with links to detailed docs)
  - Contribution guidelines
  - Issue tracking and work item management

#### AI Agent Onboarding Protocol (AI-focused)
- Purpose: Streamline AI agent integration with the system
- Content sources:
  - agent_interaction.md
  - git_workflow.md
  - handling_changes.md
  - agile/process.md
- Key sections:
  - System architecture overview
  - Available workflows and when to use them
  - Rules for code generation and modification
  - Documentation standards
  - Testing requirements

### 2. Streamlined MCP Workflows & Cursor Rules

#### MCP Workflows Review
- Inventory all .mcp-workflows/*.yml files
- Identify overlapping or redundant workflows
- Consolidate similar workflows (especially 'thinking modes')
- Document trigger conditions and purpose for each workflow

#### Cursor Rules Simplification
- Inventory all .cursor/rules/*.mdc files
- Identify complex or overly specific rules
- Simplify rule descriptions
- Ensure clear documentation of trigger conditions
- Optimize path-matching capabilities

### 3. Documentation Structure Refinement

#### docs/index.md Enhancement
- Redesign for intuitive navigation
- Add visual guides and diagrams
- Implement clear section organization

#### Common Tasks Section
- Identify frequent developer activities
- Create direct links to relevant workflows
- Include examples for common scenarios
- Link to specific MCP workflows (e.g., github_feature_branch_creation_mode)

### 4. Work Item Templates Simplification

#### Epic Template
- Review current template
- Identify essential fields for creation time
- Move non-essential fields to later stages
- Streamline for faster creation

#### Story Template
- Review current template
- Remove detailed implementation notes from creation stage
- Focus on user value and acceptance criteria
- Simplify for quicker creation

#### Task Template
- Review current template
- Focus on actionable information
- Ensure clear connection to parent Story
- Optimize for developer efficiency
