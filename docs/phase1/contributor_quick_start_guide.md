# Contributor Quick Start Guide

## Introduction

Welcome to our project! This guide provides essential information to help you get started quickly as a contributor. Rather than duplicating extensive documentation, this guide serves as a central entry point with links to more detailed resources when needed.

## Getting Started

### Environment Setup

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone [repository-url]
   cd [repository-name]
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**
   ```bash
   # Follow project-specific installation instructions
   # Typically includes package installation and environment setup
   ```

3. **Configure development tools**
   - Set up your IDE with recommended extensions
   - Configure linting and formatting tools
   - Install pre-commit hooks for quality checks

### First-time Setup Verification

Run the verification script to ensure your environment is correctly configured:
```bash
./scripts/verify-setup.sh
```

## Repository Structure

Our repository is organized as follows:

```
/
├── .cursor/            # Cursor AI assistant configuration
│   └── rules/          # Context-specific guidance rules
├── .mcp-workflows/     # MCP workflow definitions
├── docs/               # Documentation
│   └── index.md        # Documentation entry point
├── src/                # Source code
├── tests/              # Test suite
└── agile/              # Agile process documentation
```

For a more detailed explanation of the repository structure, see [File Organization Documentation](link-to-file-organization-doc).

## Common Workflows

### Starting a New Feature

1. Create a new feature branch from the main branch:
   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name main
   ```
   
2. Create appropriate work items (Epic/Story/Task) in the issue tracking system
   - See [Work Item Management](#work-item-management) below
   
3. Implement your feature following our [Coding Standards](link-to-coding-standards)

4. Create a Pull Request when ready for review
   - See [Pull Request Process](#pull-request-process) below

For more details, see [Git Workflow Documentation](link-to-git-workflow-doc).

### Bug Fixes

1. Create a bug fix branch:
   ```bash
   git checkout -b fix/bug-description main
   ```
   
2. Create a Task work item linked to the bug
   
3. Implement the fix with appropriate tests

4. Create a Pull Request with a reference to the bug

For more details, see [Bug Fix Process](link-to-bug-fix-process).

### Documentation Updates

1. Create a documentation branch:
   ```bash
   git checkout -b docs/topic-description main
   ```
   
2. Update documentation following our [Documentation Guidelines](link-to-doc-guidelines)

3. Create a Pull Request for review

## Work Item Management

We use a hierarchical work item structure:

- **Epics**: Large initiatives that deliver significant business value
- **Stories**: User-focused features that provide value
- **Tasks**: Specific implementation work items

### Creating Work Items

1. Navigate to the issue tracker
2. Select the appropriate template (Epic, Story, or Task)
3. Fill in the required fields
4. Link to parent items as appropriate

For detailed guidance, see [Work Item Management Documentation](link-to-work-item-doc).

## Pull Request Process

1. Ensure all tests pass locally
2. Create a Pull Request with a descriptive title
3. Fill in the PR template with:
   - Description of changes
   - Link to related work items
   - Testing performed
   - Documentation updates

4. Request reviews from appropriate team members
5. Address review feedback
6. Merge when approved

For more details, see [PR Process Documentation](link-to-pr-process).

## Commit Message Guidelines

We follow the Conventional Commits standard:

```
<type>(<scope>): <description>

[optional body]

[optional footer(s)]
```

Common types include:
- `feat`: New feature
- `fix`: Bug fix
- `docs`: Documentation changes
- `refactor`: Code refactoring
- `test`: Adding or updating tests
- `chore`: Maintenance tasks

Always include the work item ID in the footer:
```
