# Work Item Templates Simplification

## Current Template Analysis

The current work item templates (Epics, Stories, and Tasks) appear to be comprehensive but potentially contain too many required fields at creation time. This simplification plan focuses on streamlining the templates to include only essential fields during initial creation, while moving non-essential details to later stages in the process.

## Epic Template Simplification

### Current Epic Template
```
# Epic: [Title]

## Business Value
[Detailed description of business value]

## Strategic Alignment
[How this epic aligns with strategic goals]

## Success Metrics
[Measurable outcomes that define success]

## Scope
[Detailed scope description]

## Out of Scope
[Explicit exclusions]

## Dependencies
[List of dependencies]

## Stakeholders
[Key stakeholders]

## Risks
[Potential risks and mitigation strategies]

## Estimated Timeline
[Timeline estimate]

## Related Documentation
[Links to PRDs, design docs, etc.]
```

### Simplified Epic Template
```
# Epic: [Title]

## Business Value
[Brief description of business value]

## Strategic Alignment
[Key strategic goals this supports]

## Success Metrics
[Primary metrics to measure success]

## Scope Summary
[High-level scope description]

## Implementation Plan

1. **Update Epic Template**:
   - Reduce required fields to Business Value, Strategic Alignment, Success Metrics, and Scope Summary
   - Move remaining fields to a section clearly marked for later completion
   - Add guidance notes for each field to clarify expectations

2. **Update Story Template**:
   - Reduce required fields to User Value, Acceptance Criteria, and Estimation
   - Move technical implementation details to a section for later completion
   - Add placeholder prompts to guide proper completion

3. **Update Task Template**:
   - Reduce required fields to Description, Acceptance Criteria, and Estimation
   - Move implementation details and tracking information to a section for later updates
   - Add automation hooks for updating Files Changed and Related PRs

4. **Implement Progressive Disclosure**:
   - Create a system to prompt for additional details at appropriate stages
   - Configure MCP workflows to guide users through template completion
   - Add validation to ensure critical fields are completed before state transitions

5. **Update Documentation**:
   - Update work item creation guides to reflect simplified templates
   - Add examples of well-formed work items at each level
   - Create quick reference guides for template completion

6. **Validation Process**:
   - Test templates with sample work items
   - Gather feedback from users on template usability
   - Refine templates based on feedback

## Benefits of Simplified Templates

1. **Reduced Initial Friction**:
   - Faster work item creation with fewer required fields
   - Lower barrier to entry for new contributors
   - Focus on essential information at creation time

2. **Progressive Detail Addition**:
   - Details added when they become relevant
   - Technical information added by implementers rather than requesters
   - Natural evolution of work items through the development lifecycle

3. **Improved Workflow Integration**:
   - Templates aligned with development process stages
   - Clear separation between planning and implementation details
   - Support for automated updates during implementation

4. **Enhanced Clarity**:
   - Essential information highlighted
   - Reduced cognitive load when reviewing work items
   - Clearer distinction between different work item types
