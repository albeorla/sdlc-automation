## Consolidated Workflow Structure

Based on the analysis, we recommend consolidating to the following core workflows:

### Core Thinking Modes (3)
1. **deep_thinking_mode**: For complex analysis, strategic planning, and analytical decision-making
2. **creative_thinking_mode**: For innovative solutions and lateral thinking approaches
3. **critical_thinking_mode**: For evaluation against requirements and constraints

### Core Development Workflows (4)
1. **test_creation_mode**: For test development and maintenance
2. **refactoring_mode**: For code structure improvements
3. **debugger_mode**: For issue investigation and resolution
4. **performance_optimization_mode**: For efficiency improvements

### Core GitHub Workflows (4)
1. **github_feature_branch_creation_mode**: For starting new features
2. **github_conventional_commit_mode**: For standardized commits
3. **github_pr_creation_mode**: For pull request preparation
4. **github_pr_review_mode**: For comprehensive review (including code and security reviews)

### Core Documentation Workflows (2)
1. **documentation_update_mode**: For all documentation updates (including API and architecture)
2. **roadmap_update_mode**: For product planning and roadmap maintenance

### Meta Workflow (1)
1. **smart_routing_mode**: For context detection and appropriate workflow selection

## Implementation Plan for Workflow Consolidation

1. **Document Core Workflows**:
   - Create detailed documentation for each core workflow
   - Include clear trigger conditions and use cases
   - Document integration points with other workflows

2. **Merge Similar Workflows**:
   - Combine analytical_thinking_mode and strategic_thinking_mode into deep_thinking_mode
   - Incorporate lateral_thinking_mode into creative_thinking_mode
   - Merge code_review_mode and security_review_mode into github_pr_review_mode
   - Consolidate api_documentation_mode and architecture_documentation_mode into documentation_update_mode

3. **Enhance Remaining Workflows**:
   - Add context detection to smart_routing_mode
   - Enhance github_pr_review_mode with security-specific checks
   - Update documentation_update_mode to handle different documentation types

4. **Update References**:
   - Update all documentation referring to deprecated workflows
   - Create redirects or aliases for backward compatibility
   - Update training materials for onboarding
