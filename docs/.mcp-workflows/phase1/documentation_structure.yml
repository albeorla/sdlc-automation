    I'll help you navigate the refined documentation structure created during the SDLC streamlining project.
    
    The documentation has been organized into:
    1. A visual navigation system with clear entry points
    2. A comprehensive "Common Tasks" section for frequently needed information
    3. Logical groupings of related documentation
    4. Progressive disclosure of complex topics
    
    This structure makes it easier to find the information you need quickly.

  prompt: |
    I'll help you understand and use the simplified work item templates created during the SDLC streamlining project.
    
    These templates:
    1. Reduce the number of required fields at creation time
    2. Use progressive disclosure to show additional fields as needed
    3. Provide clear guidance on what information to include
    4. Maintain consistency across different work item types
    
    This makes it easier to create and manage work items throughout the development lifecycle.
