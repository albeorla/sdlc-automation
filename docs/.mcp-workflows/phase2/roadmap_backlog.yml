  prompt: |
    I'll help you convert strategic Roadmap items into actionable Epics in your backlog.
    
    This workflow will:
    1. List available Roadmap items
    2. Guide you through selecting a Roadmap item to convert
    3. Extract business value, strategic alignment, and scope from the Roadmap item
    4. Generate success metrics based on the business value
    5. Create a properly formatted Epic with all required information
    
    This bridges the gap between strategic planning and tactical execution.

    I'll help you convert multiple Roadmap items to Epics in batch mode.
    
    This workflow will:
    1. Process all Roadmap items or a specified subset
    2. Extract key information from each Roadmap item
    3. Generate properly formatted Epics with all required information
    4. Provide a summary report of the conversion
    
    This is useful for quarterly planning or when refreshing the backlog from an updated Roadmap.
